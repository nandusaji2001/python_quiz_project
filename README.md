# python_quiz_project
This project implements a simple quiz game in Python where users can choose between different categories of questions (sports, movies, and politics) and then answer questions within those categories.The Question class is defined to represent a single question-answer pair. Instances of this class hold a question and its correct answer.Questions are categorized into four lists: football_questions, cricket_questions, movie_questions, and politics_questions, each containing instances of the Question class.There are four functions (run_football_questions, run_cricket_questions, run_movie_questions, and run_politics_questions) which take the user through a quiz for each respective category. These functions iterate over the questions, prompt the user for answers, and provide feedback on correctness while keeping score.
The main part of the code prompts the user to choose a category (movies, sports, or politics), then based on the choice, prompts for further input to select the specific type of questions (football, cricket, or just proceed with the chosen category). After that, it calls the appropriate function to run the quiz.At the end of each quiz, it displays the number of correct answers and the total score.The code also handles user interaction at the beginning, asking if they want to play and exiting if they decline.
